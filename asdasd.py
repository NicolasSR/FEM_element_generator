x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the finite element solution (uh) and test function (v)
u, v = sp.Function('u')(x, y), sp.Function('v')(x, y)

# Define the volume element (dx)
dx = sp.diff(x, x)*sp.diff(y, y)

# Now you can plug these terms into the weak form of the PDE
weak_form = sp.integrate(grad_uh*grad_v*dx, (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1)) - sp.integrate(f*v*dx, (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))

"""
In this code:
- We first import SymPy and define the spatial coordinates `x` and `y`.
- We then define the finite element solution `u`, test function `v`, and source term `f` as SymPy functions.
- We define the gradient of the finite element solution `∇u_h` and the gradient of the test function `∇v` using SymPy's `diff` function.
- We define the volume element `dx` by taking the partial derivatives of `x` and `y` with respect to themselves.
- Finally, we plug these terms into the weak form of the PDE and use SymPy's `integrate` function to compute the integrals.
Note that in this example, we're assuming a 2D domain with `x` and `y` ranging from `-1` to `1`.
You can adjust the limits of integration to match your specific problem."
